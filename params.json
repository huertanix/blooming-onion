Its protocols allow your blog posts to travel freely to a global audience, but at the price of surrendering your anonymity to that audience through the mechanisms of ICANN when you register a domain name. Tor onion (aka \"hidden\") services offer an alternative to that paradigm by allowing anyone to create a web presence on the Tor ~*darknet*~ without giving up any of your deets to ICANN or your blog's IP address to anyone at all. Self-hosted blogs and onion services take some skills to set up, so we created this script to let you run a DigitalOcean 1-Click Application for Ghost blog as a Tor .onion service to make it easy to set up completely from inside the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/). To see an example, go to this .onion address in the Tor Browser: v4uvcyaykxrfbxdn.onion.\r\n\r\nThis code was released with some [slides from Rightscon](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17rottcLMWMMRiZ6kZ4tCXoDpMGBhismLQeT4Bghqt6w/edit?usp=sharing) 2016 which you should look over to understand how this works and learn how to further protect your anonymity.\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\nThis is very new code. It was not made by professional security experts. It had an 0Day discovered on the first day of its release. Do not use it to launch the next Wikileaks without hiring a professional to audit its code and a sysadmin to keep everything patched and up-to-date.\r\n\r\n### Install\r\nSee README.md for instructions on how to get Blooming Onion set up.\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nDo you want to improve the hastily-coded bash scripts that make up Blooming Onion. Fork our [Github repo](https://github.com/huertanix/blooming-onion) and submit a pull request! Found some 0day and want to report it and collect a bounty of 5 fresh strawberries? Submit a Github issue with the \"0DAY\" tag and mention @huertanix to collect your bounty. Strawberries may not arrive fresh if shipped.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nCreated by @huertanix with help from @corcra for a presentation with @csinders at [Rightscon 2016](https://www.rightscon.org/). Bash scripting protips by @supertunaman. Original concept by @brianloveswords.\r\n",
