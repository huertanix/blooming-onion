Its protocols allow your blog posts to travel freely to a global audience, but at the price of surrendering your anonymity to that audience through the mechanisms of ICANN when you register a domain name. Tor onion (aka \"hidden\") services offer an alternative to that paradigm by allowing anyone to create a web presence on the Tor ~* darknet *~ without giving up any of your deets to ICANN or your blog's IP address to anyone at all. Self-hosted blogs and onion services take some skills to set up, so we created this script to let you run a DigitalOcean 1-Click Application for Ghost blog as a Tor .onion service to make it easy to set up completely from inside the Tor Browser.\r\n\r\n### Install\r\nSee README.md for instructions on how to get Blooming Onion set up.\r\n\r\n### Contributing\r\nDo you want to improve the hastily-coded bash scripts that make up Blooming Onion. Fork our [Github repo](https://github.com/huertanix/blooming-onion) and submit a pull request! Found some 0day and want to report it and collect a bounty of 5 fresh strawberries? Submit a Github issue with the \"0DAY\" tag and mention @huertanix to collect your bounty. Strawberries may not arrive fresh if shipped.\r\n\r\n### Mad Props and Big Ups\r\nCreated by @huertanix with help from @corcra for Rightscon 2016. Bash scripting protips by @supertunaman. Original concept by @brianloveswords.\r\n",
